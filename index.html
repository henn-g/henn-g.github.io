    <h1 class="cellHeader">The Case for Lyft</h1>
    <p class="cellText">
      Hi, my name is Henry, and my team and I took a look at how 
      to make Lyft fit the needs for more people. 
    </p>
    <img class="centerContent" id="imageHeader" src="images/lyft.jpg" alt="lyft background">
  
    <br >
    <h2>A Thing to Note</h2>
    <p>
        From the very start of this case study, the team and I focused on finding appropriate ways to 
        better accommodate the needs for rideshare users. In comparing Uber and Lyft, we immediately 
        observed that Uber had already provided much more resources and rider options, whereas Lyft was 
        clearly lacking those features for their users. This motivated the team to shift our focus on 
        extending features to offer more 
        options for their riders to remain competitive with Uber. Throughout our process, everyone had 
        a chance to do a bit of everything, but I found myself gravitating more towards synthesizing and 
        interpreting the data gathered from our test sessions. Overall, our team was able to come up with a
        feature set that can augment the overall user experience for Lyft’s customers. 
    </p>
  
    <br /> 
  
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      We started at looking at some current pain points using Lyft’s 
      service. The company claims that their “standard car (has) four seats 
      all to yourself, and all the trunk space you need for your groceries 
      or your luggage.” (<a href="https://www.lyft.com/rider">https://www.lyft.com/rider</a>) 
      How does a Lyft driver know what riders are carrying and can guarantee that it will 
      fit? How can a rider confidently know that a standard lyft will fit their luggage
      without having to order a larger, more expensive, ride? 
  
      We defined the primary goal for the project:
      Our design goal was to extend Lyft’s user flow to accommodate riders 
      with large or sensitive items, and to prepare drivers to anticipate 
      those needs. 
  
      The team then moved to establish that our target users would be avid 
      travelers and those whose hobbies require large gear and their Lyft 
      drivers. 
  
    </p>
  
    <h2>Research Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Goals:
      We realized that we needed to quantify and qualify the 
      amount of trouble riders had with placing cargo into Lyft. 
      So we conducted interviews, sent out surveys online, and referred
      to Lyft’s user data to continue to validate our design solution.
      These different methods were enough to capture relevant data for 
      our team to continue with our process. 
  
      <br />
      Findings:
      <img src="images/lyftSurveydata.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
      <br />
  
      From the surveys we sent out online, we gathered that at least half of 
      Lyft riders in San Diego use Lyft to commute to and from the airport. 
      At least 25% of students engage in active hobbies that require larger 
      equipment, and more than 3 out of 4 cyclists needed to call a family 
      friend because of a bike malfunction. 
      <br />
      <img src="images/lyftProblemContext.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault" >
      From casual conversations with Lyft drivers, our team also discovered 
      that drivers are not sure if their rider has luggage or not, while some 
      riders reported that they were not 100% confident that their luggage 
      could fit into their rides. This happens because Lyft lacks the tools 
      to convey this critical information between riders and drivers. 
  
    </p>
  
    <br />
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      How can we help riders be able to confidently order vehicles with the 
      proper ability to carry their cargo? How can we help drivers be 
      accurately aware of their riders’ cargo and be confident they can 
      transport cargo without damage to their vehicle?
    </p>
    <br />
  
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <img src="images/lyftUserPersonas.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <br />
  
    <h2>UX / UI Flows</h2>
    <p>
      We started by sketching out and comparing our various ideas for the 
      direction of the project.
    </p>
    <img src="images/lyftUXFlowSketches.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <p>
      After some deliberation, we agreed on the following ideas we would
      continue to persue. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/lyftUserFlows.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <br />
  
    <h2>Prototyping Process</h2>
    <p>
      We looked at the user data that our team gathered, in addition to some 
      of our preliminary sketches. We produced AB paper  prototypes that we 
      thought were sufficient enough for a user test session with our 
      prototypes.
    </p>
    <p>Paper Prototype A</p>
    <img src="images/lyftPaperPrototypeA-overview.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <img src="images/lyftPaperPrototypeA-screens.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <br />
  
    <p>Paper Prototype B</p>
    <img src="images/lyftPaperPrototypeB-overview.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <img src="images/lyftPaperPrototypeB-screesn.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <br />
  
    <p>We collected feedback on our AB prototypes</p>
    <img src="images/lyftUserTesting.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <p>
      After conducting a user test session, we found that people liked the pop 
      up screens of asking number of bags in prototype A. People who have a 
      large cargo can request a lyft with fast action 
      of pressing a few buttons. Also, prototype A takes many inputs from the 
      user about the object so that the driver can easily know what the driver 
      is going to load in the car. However, people felt inconvenient because 
      there are many steps to go through in order to request a Lyft. In 
      contrast, people liked the feature of selecting an object option in the 
      beginning of prototype B because people can pick their object faster than 
      prototype A. Also people like the general flow of prototype B and we 
      believe this is because of the simple steps of putting an object name 
      and size with the option of normal Lyft and XL. Even though people like 
      the idea of putting the cargo size, they did not prefer the size bar and 
      scroll features in both prototype A and B. Our team made these features 
      for the drivers but realized that it could be asking too much for the 
      users when they simply want to order a Lyft with a big trunk or a rack. 
      In addition, when people choose the option for taking a picture of the 
      object, they were concerned about the size of the object picture because 
      it might look different in the picture and the driver could misunderstand 
      of the object size.
      <br />
      With this all in mind, our team moved to creating higher fidelity 
      prototypes.
      <br />
      This higher fidelity mockup was heavily based on our Type 3 Flow and 
      Paper Prototype B. We included 2 alternative screens to offer people 
      during our next user testing session. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/lyftFirstHighFi.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <p>
      Our following user testing session revealed the following:
      <br />
      Interviewee 1 is a fourth year student at UCSD and barely uses Lyft.
      He liked the flow of choosing cargo option from swiping to the right.
      One thing that he was a little confused about was the color of the 
      illustrated cars being green. He mentioned that green color does not 
      match with the overall Lyft brand. Otherwise, he liked the addition 
      of ‘other’ option on the bottom of the cargo options. He also said 
      that the previous screen had only the scale bar with no number on it 
      and the final of the size screen is much better because it now has the 
      range and choices of inches and centimeters of the size with optional 
      pictures.
      <br />
      Interviewee 2 is a UCSD working recent alum who is a frequent user of 
      Lyft for travel. He liked the “Common Cargo” screen with pictures of 
      cars because it was meaningful to see how cargo could fit on the Lyft 
      vehicle. He also liked how items shown were specialized to what cargo 
      he was likely to bring based on past rides. However, they did not 
      understand why this screen did not have the “Others” option and 
      mentioned he did not think another button for this would crowd the 
      screen. Thus, we added the “Others” section to this screen adding 
      functionality.
      <br />
      Interviewee 3 is also a working recent UCSD alum, and often uses 
      Lyft on the weekends. She liked the team’s first iteration of the 
      prototype overall. However, she did not like the original second 
      screen, which lacked any visual aids to help conceptually picture the 
      type of car that would be requested. The first alternate screen was a 
      much better fit in that regard. The screen that specified the “Other 
      Cargo” category was intuitive for her to understand at a first glance 
      as well. The screen that asks the user to specify the cargo size felt 
      too ambiguous to her at first, mostly because there weren’t any more 
      specific indications as to what exact measurements that the sliders 
      would be creating. The photo feature was a better alternative as 
      opposed to using the siders. 
      <br />
      We also considered feedback about our “Size Selection” screen from 
      our TA. They mentioned how the scroll bars had no reference as to what 
      high or low on the bar actually meant in reality. To add more clarity 
      we added a numeric scale to our bars as well as a conversion switch in 
      the corner to control units of measurement. We also added common 
      luggage size buttons like “Carry On” and “Check In” which snap scroll
      bars into a default size. Thus users can have a reference point to 
      measure their luggage with. We wanted to have a balance of accuracy and 
      clarity without being too strict and demanding for the user when 
      measuring cargo. In addition, we decided to have the camera be an 
      optional addition to the measuring scroll bars instead of a “this OR 
      that” feature. We thought the photo alone did not have too much value 
      alone, but coupled with the sizing feature had more of a purpose so 
      the driver knows exactly what they are picking up.
      <br />
      With all of this in mind, we iterated our high fidelity to look as such:
    </p>
    <img src="images/lyftFinalPrototype.png" class="centerContent scaleDefault">
    <p>
      As an added bonus, we included some before and after screens from our 
      earlier high fidelity prototype to the most current that fit the needs 
      of the users that we tested. 
    </p>
    <br />

    <br />
    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, the team managed to design a new feature set that would create meaningful value to Lyft’s customers. 
      Designing for a problem in this context gave us valuable experience as to how a more established organization 
      can have their products improved even more over time. Throughout the process, the team remained focused on our 
      goals and ensuring that we do not add unnecessary information in the overall user experience flow. It would be
      no suprise to be if Lyft eventually integrated this feature into their product, since they must remain competative 
      with Uber.
